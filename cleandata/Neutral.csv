Neutral,Neutral or Mixed Feelings,F,"A casino can bring hundreds, maybe thousands of jobs which will greatly benefit the economy of the city. The casino will attract thousands, and eventually crime rates will go up. Drinking and drug use will also go up.

Neutral,Neutral or Mixed Feelings,F,I think Toronto could support and receive net benefits from a full service casino.
