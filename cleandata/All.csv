Problem gambling is associated with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and suicide; it also affects family and marital relationships, work and academic performance, and can lead to bankruptcy and crime. Suicide is a critical concern. A recent study found that a quarter of Ontario student problems with gambling problems reported a suicide attempt in the past year � roughly 18 times higher than in the general student population (Cook et al., 2010). The risk of suicide is also high among older adults with gambling problems (Nower & Blaszcynski, 2008). Research shows that increases in gambling availability including location and extended hours of operation are associated with increases in problem gambling. There is international evidence that the number of people presenting for problem gambling treatment and the number of bankruptcies both rise following the opening of casinos (Williams, Rehm, and Stevens, 2011).

How much people spend on entertainment is not unlimited.  Casino popularity is driven, in part, by spectacle: how many of the surrounding, independent venues will not be able to compete with a multinational's ability to out-spectacle legitimate culturally productive businesses? While independent business will plough profits back into surrounding neighbourhoods, a multinational gambling consortium will maximize how much wealth is redirected out of our economy, into head offices located in offshore tax havens, etc.  Casinos ultimately drain wealth, prosperity from communities and leave debt, bankruptcy, domestic violence, drug and alcohol addiction, crime, and suicide behind.",35-44,Male,m5c

Opposed,Strongly Opposed,T,"Any new casino in Toronto would incur social costs (related to gambling addiction, alcohol abuse, etc) that all taxpayers ALSO pay for. These negative social costs do not outweigh (and really should not even be directly compared to) the potential net revenue that increasingly failing casinos around North America may generate. Casinos (especially large-scale showcase projects) suck the lifeblood from local, small- to medium, and even larger competing shopping mall businesses as well as pedestrian traffic in the area because the nature of a successful casino is to keep people inside the casino. These negative spin-off effects of a successful casino would depress the local economy and actually detract a wide spectrum of non-gambling visitors from coming to whatever community a casino may be located in. Again, in context, a casino does not meet the multiple concurrent objectives of the City of Toronto to generate long-term revenues and to create an innovative, sustainable, attractive city in the 21st century. Casinos are a passe idea that do not generate any where near the net revenues or jobs that proponents market to the City and the public - even without accounting for the social costs to taxpayers. If the Government of Ontario locates a casino in Toronto, this will necessarily significantly endanger any revenues other smaller municipalities with more simple local economies throughout the province currently receive. The net economic and social benefits to Toronto are marginal but other smaller municipalities rely heavily on the benefits of their (nearby) casinos. These competing objectives do not make sense other than the potential benefit from large campaign donations.",35-44,Female,M4J

With tens of thousands of new condo units being occupied every quarter of every year, the downtown core is becoming more congested, and the infrastructure is already being strained.

Opposed,Strongly Opposed,T,"The costs of gambling are far greater than the benefits. Studies show that for every dollar gambling produces for a local economy, three dollars are lost because of the economic and social costs of gambling. When government legalizes gambling, taxpayers lose - whether they gamble or not.  In a U.S. study, Professor John Kindt of the University of Illinois concluded that for every dollar of gambling revenue received by the state, taxpayers must put up a minimum of three dollars to cover expenses created by gambling. He found these costs include infrastructure expenditures, regulatory costs, expenses related to the criminal justice system and large social-welfare costs. (John Kindt, Statement before a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business, September 21, 1994.) Gambling cannibalizes local businesses. A hundred dollars spent in a slot machine is a hundred dollars that is not spent in a local restaurant, theater or retail store. As Donald Trump told the Miami Herald, ""People will spend a tremendous amount of money in casinos, money that they would normally spend on buying a refrigerator or a new car. Local businesses will suffer because they'll lose customer dollars to the casinos.""  In a study conducted for the Ford Foundation, Robert Goodman refers to the ""cannibalization"" of non-gambling businesses, a term which he uses to describe the substantial decline in both jobs and revenues experienced by many nearby enterprises.  Money for gambling is usually diverted from people's discretionary expenditures. Not only are dollars diverted from other products and services, but governments often lose sales taxes which would have been spent on those products and services. (Goodman, Legalized Gambling, p. 51.) Gambling leads to addiction and crime.  Gambling addiction has become an epidemic among youth.  According to Dr. Howard Shaffer, Director of the Harvard Medical School Center for Addiction Studies, ""Today, there are more children experiencing adverse symptoms from gambling than from drugs...and the problem is growing.""  Also, the serious problems associated with compulsive gambling affect more than the gamblers and their families; society has to pay a staggering amount as a result of that irresponsible behavior. Henry Lesieur, who chairs the department of criminal justice at Illinois State University, has found that compulsive gamblers engage in an estimated $1.3 billion in insurance-related fraud each year.

A new casino will bring about many related issues - prostitution, loan sharks, extortion, and abuses that are all part of the problem and increase crime rate.

Current sharing rate in Ontario is about 4/96!). Now the OLG, the ones that will be handing out the money, have told the city to expect even less! At the current average 4% casino revenue for municipalities, Toronto would get ~$15m. And dont forget about all the associated costs.
