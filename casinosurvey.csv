Strongly Opposed,"I believe that gambling is a public health issue as the harms of problem gambling to individuals and the costs to society are enormous.

Problem gambling is associated with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and suicide; it also affects family and marital relationships, work and academic performance, and can lead to bankruptcy and crime. Suicide is a critical concern. A recent study found that a quarter of Ontario student problems with gambling problems reported a suicide attempt in the past year � roughly 18 times higher than in the general student population (Cook et al., 2010). The risk of suicide is also high among older adults with gambling problems (Nower & Blaszcynski, 2008).","Research shows that increases in gambling availability including location and extended hours of operation are associated with increases in problem gambling. There is international evidence that the number of people presenting for problem gambling treatment and the number of bankruptcies both rise following the opening of casinos (Williams, Rehm, and Stevens, 2011).","Any legislation enacted by the City of Toronto, such as gambling policy, should privileges public health over revenues to mitigate the harms associated with problem gambling.",T,25-34,Female,m6n

Gambling is a past-time that the majority of the Toronto public would not participate in and would not enjoy.  The secondary 'benefits' of claimed economic gain from taxation of gambling facilities is rejected sinceToronto could do better by developing these areas in a way that DIRECTLY benefit more members of the public while excluding gambling from the city. Niagara Falls by way of comparision is primarily a tourist destination (the falls) whereas Toronto is a vibrant and diverse City.  Unlike Casino Niagara, Toronto has a lot to lose if gambling diminishes our city`s existing culture of diversity.  Gambling will either drive away or simply displace activities that would otherwise help this City be a good place to live and work.

Strongly Opposed,"Any new casino in Toronto would incur social costs (related to gambling addiction, alcohol abuse, etc) that all taxpayers ALSO pay for. These negative social costs do not outweigh (and really should not even be directly compared to) the potential net revenue that increasingly failing casinos around North America may generate.","Casinos (especially large-scale showcase projects) suck the lifeblood from local, small- to medium, and even larger competing shopping mall businesses as well as pedestrian traffic in the area because the nature of a successful casino is to keep people inside the casino. These negative spin-off effects of a successful casino would depress the local economy and actually detract a wide spectrum of non-gambling visitors from coming to whatever community a casino may be located in. Again, in context, a casino does not meet the multiple concurrent objectives of the City of Toronto to generate long-term revenues and to create an innovative, sustainable, attractive city in the 21st century. Casinos are a passe idea that do not generate any where near the net revenues or jobs that proponents market to the City and the public - even without accounting for the social costs to taxpayers.","If the Government of Ontario locates a casino in Toronto, this will necessarily significantly endanger any revenues other smaller municipalities with more simple local economies throughout the province currently receive.

These competing objectives do not make sense other than the potential benefit from large campaign donations.",T,35-44,Female,M4J

There are much healthier ways to spur economic development.","Toronto has a global reputation as a great place to raise families.  If we allow casinos to compromise that image, we will suffer economically, as it will become more difficult to attract world-class talent to Bay Street, our most important driver of economic growth.","With tens of thousands of new condo units being occupied every quarter of every year, the downtown core is becoming more congested, and the infrastructure is already being strained.

Strongly Opposed,"The costs of gambling are far greater than the benefits. Studies show that for every dollar gambling produces for a local economy, three dollars are lost because of the economic and social costs of gambling. When government legalizes gambling, taxpayers lose - whether they gamble or not.  In a U.S. study, Professor John Kindt of the University of Illinois concluded that for every dollar of gambling revenue received by the state, taxpayers must put up a minimum of three dollars to cover expenses created by gambling. He found these costs include infrastructure expenditures, regulatory costs, expenses related to the criminal justice system and large social-welfare costs. (John Kindt, Statement before a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Small Business, September 21, 1994.)","Gambling cannibalizes local businesses. A hundred dollars spent in a slot machine is a hundred dollars that is not spent in a local restaurant, theater or retail store. As Donald Trump told the Miami Herald, ""People will spend a tremendous amount of money in casinos, money that they would normally spend on buying a refrigerator or a new car. Local businesses will suffer because they'll lose customer dollars to the casinos.""  In a study conducted for the Ford Foundation, Robert Goodman refers to the ""cannibalization"" of non-gambling businesses, a term which he uses to describe the substantial decline in both jobs and revenues experienced by many nearby enterprises.  Money for gambling is usually diverted from people's discretionary expenditures. Not only are dollars diverted from other products and services, but governments often lose sales taxes which would have been spent on those products and services. (Goodman, Legalized Gambling, p. 51.)","Gambling leads to addiction and crime.  Gambling addiction has become an epidemic among youth.  According to Dr. Howard Shaffer, Director of the Harvard Medical School Center for Addiction Studies, ""Today, there are more children experiencing adverse symptoms from gambling than from drugs...and the problem is growing.""  Also, the serious problems associated with compulsive gambling affect more than the gamblers and their families; society has to pay a staggering amount as a result of that irresponsible behavior. Henry Lesieur, who chairs the department of criminal justice at Illinois State University, has found that compulsive gamblers engage in an estimated $1.3 billion in insurance-related fraud each year.
